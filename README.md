# Introduction
This project aims to predict the price of yearly medical insurance costs based on various factors such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, and smoking habit. The dataset used for this task is sourced from Kaggle and contains information relevant for insurance premium determination. We will follow these steps to build the predictive model:

Download and explore the dataset
Prepare the dataset for training
Create a linear regression model
Train the model to fit the data
Make predictions using the trained model
The assignment builds upon concepts covered in the initial lessons on PyTorch basics, linear regression, and logistic regression. It is recommended to review the provided Jupyter notebooks for a better understanding.

# Step 1: Download and Explore the Data
The dataset is downloaded using the download_url function from PyTorch and loaded into a Pandas dataframe for exploration. A slight customization is applied to the data using the participant's name as a source of random numbers. Basic questions about the dataset, such as the number of rows and columns, non-numeric columns, and target variables, are answered to gain insights into the data.

# Step 2: Prepare the Dataset for Training
The data is converted from the Pandas dataframe into PyTorch tensors and split into training and validation sets. PyTorch datasets and data loaders are created to facilitate training and validation of the model.

# Step 3: Create a Linear Regression Model
A simple linear regression model is defined using PyTorch's nn.Module class. The model architecture includes a linear layer to map input features to the output prediction. Methods for training, validation, and evaluation of the model are implemented within the class.

# Step 4: Train the Model to Fit the Data
The model is trained using the provided training loop, which iterates over multiple epochs and adjusts the model parameters based on the calculated loss. Different hyperparameters such as learning rate and number of epochs are experimented with to optimize the model's performance.

# Step 5: Make Predictions Using the Trained Model
A function is defined to make predictions on single input samples using the trained model. Predictions are compared with actual targets to assess the model's accuracy and performance.

By following these steps and experimenting with various hyperparameters, the goal is to build a robust predictive model for insurance cost estimation. Further improvements can be made by fine-tuning the model architecture and exploring more advanced techniques in future iterations of the project.
